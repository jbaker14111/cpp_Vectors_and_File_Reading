# C++ Vectors and File Reading
This is a project I completed while attending Liberty University Online. It uses vectors in c++ as well as reads data from a file. The code will prompt you to enter a file name, and read its contents if the file exists.

<h3>This project...</h3>
&nbsp; 1. reads file input <br>
&nbsp; 2. uses vectors to grow information that may expand over time <br>
&nbsp; 3. does NOT check for error in file input. Implementing this did not fall within the scope of the project <br>
